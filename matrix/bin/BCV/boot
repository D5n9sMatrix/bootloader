# BCV
# A Boot Connection Vector is a pointer that points to code inside the option ROM that
# will perform device initialization, detect if a peripheral (such as a SCSI hard drive) is
# attached, and optionally hook INT 13h. The BCV resides in a PnP option ROM
# Expansion Header. An example of an option ROM with a BCV is a PnP ISA SCSI
# controller
