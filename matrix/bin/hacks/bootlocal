# Introduction
# Linux is a common operating system for computers, and especially
# the server computers. The funny thing with it is that people view Linux as a
# very complex operating system which is not the case. This is why most
# computer novice users don’t like using Linux on their computers. However,
# this is not the case. Just like the Windows OS, Linux is an easy-to-use
# operating system. All one needs to have is interest in learning it. The
# operating system itself is very secure, meaning that hackers will find it
# almost impossible to hack into it.

# The various distributions of Linux use almost the same commands. These
# commands can be written using the same syntax and they run successfully
# on various distributions of Linux. However, some of them will need to be
# altered slightly so that they can be compatible. You should identify the right
# distribution for yourself and your computer and install it on your system.
# The right choice for you in this case will depend on the distribution that you
# will feel comfortable to work with. Other than installing the operating
# system directly onto your hard disk, you can choose to run it on virtual box
# or VMware player. This can help in saving on the available computer space,
# hence important.

# Chapter 1- Definition
# Linux is an open-source operating system for computers. It was
# developed to provide a Unix-like free and open source operating system for
# computers. The kernel is the main component of Linux operating system
# and its first version was released in the year 1991 by Linus Torvalds. People
# rarely use Linux operating system on desktop computers. This operating
# system has shown a wide use on server computers. The reason is due to its
# high level of security. For instance, those who have worked with server
# computers running Linux, you must have realized that the operating system
# supports no graphics.

# After booting up the computer, what you are provided with is just a
# blinking cursor. You then have to provide commands to the terminal. This is
# of great advantage when it comes to ensuring security of the system. Note
# that graphics and any other additional feature added to the operating system
# are an advantage to the hacker as they can gain access into the system via
# this feature. If you don’t the commands used on the command line, then
# definitely you be stuck. However, the desktop versions of Linux supports
# graphics.
