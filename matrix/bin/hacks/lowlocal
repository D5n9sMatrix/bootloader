# There are various distributions of Linux, commonly known as Linux
# Distros. These include Ubuntu, Khali, Red Hat, Fedora, Mint, Centos,
# SUSE and others. These Distros exhibit numerous similarities although
# there are fewer differences amongst themselves. This involves even the
# commands used on their terminals. For enterprise distributions of Linux
# such as Red Hat, a subscription fee must be paid for you to enjoy the
# services that they offer. This includes even updating of the OS.
