# DDIM
# The Device Driver Initialization Model is a method of initializing an option ROM
# whereby the option ROM is first copied to shadow RAM, then its initialization vector
# is called with the shadow RAM write-enabled. When the option ROM completes
# initialization it may dispose of code not needed at run-time by re-sizing the ROM
# memory footprint. Finally, after the option ROM returns and the BIOS regains
# control, the ROM is write-protected.
